## 🧠 Research: How Malicious Extensions Harm Users

- **Data Theft:** Some extensions can capture sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, or browsing history.
- **Ad Injection:** Malicious plugins often inject unwanted ads into websites, compromising user experience and trust.
- **Browser Hijacking:** They can redirect search queries to malicious websites or alter browser settings without consent.
- **Surveillance:** Extensions may track user activity, mouse movements, and clicks to build behavioral profiles.
- **Cryptojacking:** Certain add-ons hijack system resources to mine cryptocurrency in the background.
- **Backdoors:** Some can act as a backdoor to deliver malware payloads or allow remote control.
