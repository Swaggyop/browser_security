8. Document steps taken and extensions removed.


To complete this task, I carefully followed a structured approach to inspect my browser’s extensions, evaluate their safety, and ensure the browser’s integrity. Below is a detailed documentation of all the steps I undertook:



🔹 Step 1: Opened Extension Manager


Launched Google Chrome and entered the URL chrome://extensions to open the Extension Manager.

This interface displays all installed extensions, their current status (enabled or disabled), and options to inspect or remove them.



🔹 Step 2: Reviewed All Installed Extensions


Upon accessing the manager, I observed that only one extension was installed:

Extension Name: Google Docs Offline

Version: 1.92.1

Status: Enabled

Purpose: Allows offline access to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.



🔹 Step 3: Analyzed Permissions and Reviews


I clicked on the "Details" button of the extension to view the permissions it requires.

Permissions included:

Access to Google Docs files.

Access to local storage (for offline document saving).

Then, I cross-checked the extension on the Chrome Web Store, confirming:

It is developed by Google LLC (trusted).

It has millions of users, high ratings, and no reported security concerns.

No red flags were found regarding malicious behavior or excessive permissions.



🔹 Step 4: Identified Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions


Since only one extension was installed, and it was verified as both safe and necessary, no extensions were flagged as suspicious or unused.

I used criteria such as:

Unfamiliar names or unknown developers.

Unusually broad permissions.

Poor user ratings or reviews mentioning data leaks, redirection, etc.



🔹 Step 5: Removal of Extensions


No extensions were removed, as there were no suspicious or unwanted extensions found during the review.

If any had been detected, I would have clicked on the “Remove” button to uninstall them immediately and logged the reason for their removal.



🔹 Step 6: Restarted the Browser


After completing the review, I closed and restarted Chrome to verify system stability and check for any performance improvements.

Result: The browser was already functioning smoothly; no abnormal behavior was observed.



🔹 Step 7: Conducted Research on Malicious Extensions:


Explored how malicious extensions function (e.g., data theft, ad injection, cryptojacking).

Reaffirmed why regular audits and minimal extension usage are crucial for cybersecurity hygiene.



🔹 Step 8: Compiled Report:


Created this full documentation including:

Screenshot evidence (as attached/uploaded earlier)

Evaluation findings

Security research

Final conclusion and best practices



📝 Summary Table of Reviewed Extension:


| **Extension Name**  | **Version** | **Publisher** | **Status** | **Action Taken** | **Remarks**                      |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Google Docs Offline | 1.92.1      | Google LLC    | Enabled    | Retained         | Safe, useful, verified extension |



✅ Final Statement:


Although no extensions were removed during this exercise, the task reinforced the importance of regularly auditing browser extensions. Even a single malicious plugin can compromise system security, user data, or performance. Keeping extensions minimal and verified is a best practice I will continue to follow and promote.
