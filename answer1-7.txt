Task Title: Identifying and Removing Potentially Harmful Browser Extensions
Tool Used: Google Chrome
Date: 05 June 2025

üßæ Objective:

To identify, analyze, and remove any potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions that may compromise user privacy or system performance.

üß© Answers to Task Questions 

1. Open your browser‚Äôs extension/add-ons manager.

I opened the extension manager in Google Chrome by navigating to chrome://extensions. This panel displays all currently installed browser extensions, both enabled and disabled. It also allows users to view extension details, permissions, and remove them if necessary.



2. Review all installed extensions carefully.


Upon accessing the extension panel, I found that only one extension was installed on the browser:

Google Docs Offline (v1.92.1)
This extension allows the creation, editing, and viewing of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides without internet access. Since it is developed by Google LLC, it is considered safe and trustworthy.



3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension.


For the Google Docs Offline extension:

I clicked on the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù button to review the permissions.

The extension requested access to:

Google Drive (to sync files offline)

File system storage (to save temporary files)

On checking the Chrome Web Store, the extension had high ratings and millions of users with mostly positive reviews.

No suspicious behavior was mentioned in any user comments.

This confirms that the extension is legitimate and safe for use.



4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions.


After reviewing the extension list:

There were no unused or suspicious extensions installed.

The system appears to be clean, with only a necessary and official productivity extension.

Hence, no action was needed for removal at this stage.



5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions.


Since no suspicious or unknown extensions were found, I did not remove any extension.
If any had been identified, I would have removed them using the ‚ÄúRemove‚Äù button and noted their names and behavior for documentation.



6. Restart browser and check for performance improvements.


After reviewing the extensions:

I closed and reopened Google Chrome to assess performance.

Since no malicious or heavy extensions were running, the browser already performed well and remained stable after restart.

No abnormal popups, CPU spikes, or redirections occurred.



7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users.


Malicious browser extensions pose serious threats to user privacy, data security, and system performance. Here are some key ways they harm users:

üî∏ 1. Data Theft
Extensions can access sensitive data such as:

Browser history

Keystrokes (e.g., login credentials)

Form inputs (e.g., credit card info)

Example: Some rogue ad-blockers have been found harvesting personal data and selling it to third-party advertisers.

üî∏ 2. Session Hijacking
Malicious extensions can hijack cookies or session tokens, allowing attackers to impersonate users on websites like Gmail or banking portals.


üî∏ 3. Ad Injection & Redirection
Some extensions modify website content to inject ads, popups, or redirect users to phishing or scam websites.


üî∏ 4. Cryptojacking
Background scripts can secretly mine cryptocurrency, consuming CPU/GPU resources without user consent. This slows down the system and increases power usage.


üî∏ 5. Remote Code Execution
Vulnerable extensions can act as a bridge for attackers to execute malicious code, install malware, or access files on the system.


üî∏ 6. Surveillance & Spying
Extensions can silently monitor every website visited and sell browsing data for advertising or political manipulation.




üìå Example Incidents:


DataSpii Incident (2019): Several Chrome and Firefox extensions were caught collecting browsing history and leaking corporate secrets.

Great Suspender (2021): A once-popular Chrome extension was sold to unknown developers and updated to include spyware-like behavior.


‚ö†Ô∏è This is why browser extension security is a critical part of modern cybersecurity hygiene.
